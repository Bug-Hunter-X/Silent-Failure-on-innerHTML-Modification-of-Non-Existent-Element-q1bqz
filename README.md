# Uncommon HTML Bug: Silent innerHTML Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript related to modifying the `innerHTML` property of a non-existent element.  The code attempts to modify an element that doesn't exist in the DOM, resulting in a silent failure rather than a clear error message.

## Bug Description
The script tries to change the content of an element with the ID 'nonExistentElement', but this element is not part of the HTML structure.  As a result, the expected change does not happen, and no error is thrown to alert the developer.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the text intended to be added via the script does not appear. No error messages are visible in the browser's developer console.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` demonstrates how to avoid this problem by first checking if the element exists before attempting to modify its `innerHTML`.

## Learning Points
- Always validate that elements exist before manipulating them in JavaScript.
- Browser developer tools are essential for debugging unexpected behavior.
